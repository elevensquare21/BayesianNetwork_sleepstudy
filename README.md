Build a Bayesian Network on sleep study data

Our study sample comprised 74 newly diagnosed stage I-III breast cancer patients scheduled to receive chemotherapy, and followed them for one year. An objective neuropsychological test battery and self-reported fatigue, mood, sleep quality, and quality of life were collected at three time points: before the start of chemotherapy (baseline: BL), at the end of cycle 4 chemotherapy (C4) and one year after the start of chemotherapy (Y1). We applied novel Bayesian network methods to investigate the role of sleep/fatigue/mood on cognition and quality of life prior to, during, and after chemotherapy.
